2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
Type of business (based on name)          
         
ii. Difference 2:
Location (based on city)        
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT name, city, stars, review_count, is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY is_open
ORDER BY stars DESC
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

Looking at what makes a top-rated business         
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

I choose to join businesses data with categories to see if how a company was classified influenced ratings.  I also looked at location and number of reviews.  Whether a business was still open or not was also a factor.                            
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:
